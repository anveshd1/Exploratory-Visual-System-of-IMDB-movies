# Exploratory-Visual-System-of-IMDB-movies
This repository includes R-shiny code(ui and server),datasets and my academic project for IMDB 5000 movies dataset. 

This dashboard attempts to demonstrate some aspects of data exploration which are uniquely suitable for visual interactions with
movies data. This is best exemplified by network graph among other interactions explained by certain scenarios in this report. Users
can explore movies based on their choices with visual interaction. This dashboard translates these interactions into filters at data
level and updates the visualizations accordingly. For example, users can explore movies based on IMDB rating, Genre, Movie
duration, country etc. This dashboard can also be used for analysis of relations between movies, actors, budget, gross, ratings,return
on investment etc. to gain some interesting insights on the roles played by these attributes.

You can view this visualization hosted on my shinyapp.io account
